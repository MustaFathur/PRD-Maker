        "content": "The existing methods for assessing palm oil maturity lack efficiency and automation. Manual processes lead to inaccuracies, delays, and a lack of centralized control. Key issue:\n Inability to obtain a comprehensive palm oil maturity across different plantations.\nincreased manual effort in coordinating maturity assessments and monitoring across various locations."

        "title": "Objective",
        "content": "The primary objective is to create an integrated solution for palm oil maturity detection and monitoring. Specific goals include:\nDevelop a CLI for users to easily detect maturity detection on individual images.\nImplement object counting in video streams to track the number of palm and their maturity levels. Integrate ESP32 Cam into the system for on-field image capture.\nEstablish connectivity with a cloud server for centralized data processing and analysis."
